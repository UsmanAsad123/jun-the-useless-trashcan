# jun-the-useless-trashcan
Jun is a trash can that refuses trash! Using an Arduino Uno, IR sensor, and two servo motors, it closes its lid when someone approaches and only opens when they walk away. Built from cardboard, it’s a deliberately useless invention that makes waste disposal frustrating instead of easy—exactly as intended!
