# The-useless-trashcan
A trash can that refuses trash! Using an Arduino Uno, IR sensor, and two servo motors, it closes its lid when someone approaches and only opens when they walk away. Built from cardboard, itâ€™s a deliberately useless invention that makes waste disposal frustrating instead of easyâ€”exactly as intended!

Project Description:
The most useless trash can ever created. Instead of helping people throw away their garbage, Jun actively refuses to do its jobâ€”closing its lid whenever someone approaches and only opening when they walk away.

Using an Arduino Uno (Leonardo) and a KS0051 Infrared Obstacle Avoidance Sensor, Jun detects how far a person is. If they are more than 100 cm away, the lid stays open, inviting trash. But the moment someone steps closer, Jun slams the lid shut, rejecting all garbage like a true rebel.

To make things even more ridiculous, Jun uses two servo motors that work in opposite directions to control the lid, making sure it closes as inconveniently as possible. The entire setup is housed in a cardboard trash can, because why not?

Technology Used: 

Arduino Uno (Leonardo) for processing
KS0051 IR Sensor for distance detection
Two Servo Motors for lid movement
Cardboard Construction for the trash can body
C++ Programming for controlling the logic
Why is Jun so useless?
Because instead of making waste disposal efficient, Jun actively prevents people from throwing trashâ€”defying the very purpose of a trash can. But thatâ€™s the beauty of it. Itâ€™s uselessness, perfected.

Potential Uses (if any ðŸ˜‚):

A prank to confuse people in public spaces
A creative way to annoy friends and family
A test of patience for anyone attempting to use it
Jun isnâ€™t just a trash can. Itâ€™s a statement. A protest. A trash can with an identity crisis. And most importantly, itâ€™s totally, absolutely useless.
